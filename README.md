The project involves implementing a simple molecular dynamics simulation and conducting several experiments for a system of atoms of one type interacting via van der Waals forces (noble gas model). The simulations will observe the phase transition from crystal to gas, and some thermodynamic properties characterizing the gas state (temperature, pressure) will be investigated. The VMD program will be used for three-dimensional visualization and animation in this project.
